What do I need to do:

-> resolve invalid certificate on client

-> continue with designing and implementing my CI/CD pipeline

-> once pipeline is running:
---> get storage controller successfully creating each of the agency object types
-----> setup using UDT's if no trouble with it on the Heroku Postgres server
-----> otherwise, continue with implementing  w/o acid compliance
---> extrapolate to include update and delete ops for each of the agency object types
---> develop and implement querrying model of all agency object types
---> setup testing of the API such that I can send request of each type for each agency object and get the expected response
---> upon successful testing of agency module api:
-----> implement the Forms module to achieve same successful testing of each operation of each form object type
---> upon successful testing of forms module api:
-----> rework the front end code to accept/handle refactored data structures
-----> continue building the ui for user to envoke business logic
