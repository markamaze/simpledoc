What do I need to do:

-> continue with designing and implementing my CI/CD pipeline
-  > get running locally with heroku cli
-  > set up testing environment on backend
-  > configure pipeline to build, test, and deploy app upon push to master


-> once pipeline is running:
-  > get storage controller successfully creating each of the agency object types
-    * setup using UDT's if no trouble with it on the Heroku Postgres server
-    * otherwise, continue with implementing  w/o acid compliance
-  > extrapolate to include update and delete ops for each of the agency object types
-  > develop and implement system to query model for all agency object types
-  > setup testing of the API such that I can send request of each type for each agency object and get the expected response
-  > implement the Forms module to achieve same successful testing of each operation of each form object type
-  > rework the front end code to accept/handle refactored data structures
-  > continue building the ui for user to envoke business logic


-> backlog:
-  > reorganize .gitignore files
-  > rename app, change to "Radar"
